This repository are random implementations of algorithms I find fun.

## Cached-Range Arithmetic Compression

**This is an implementation of the arithmetic compression algoritm using my self-created algorithm the CachedRange.**

As it's name indicate, the CachedRange algorithm caches commmon bits between min and max bounds of the range. This allows to use a REALLY big floating point without loosing precision
